## My process
I started in the HTML, removing style tags and creating a CSS file to write those separately and linked it to the HTML file, as well as linking in the google fonts. Next, I wrapped the content of the page into containers and appropriate tags. The text was split into h1 and p tags, I added the qr code jpg with an img tag, and then all of it wrapped into a container div. Lastly, I gave class names to the content I'd have to style.

In the CSS file, I gave the container the flex: display attribute and aligned everything to the center, then used min-height: 100vh to center the card to the middle of the page. Next, I added all of the necessary font and color attributes as described in the style-guide. Lastly, I played with the max-width and margin attributes of the content to ensure the spacing was all correct.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a nice refresher on using flexbox to center components responsively.
